## analyses

1.The hacker create ERC20 pair in uniswap V2: WETH and token MIKE. 

2.The victims use WETH to buy token MIKE in the liquidity pool of uniswap V2.

3.The hacker adds victims into blacklist and mints token to himself.

4.When victims call `transferFrom()` , the transaction will fail because they r in blacklist. In this case, there will be more and more WETHs in the pool, with fewer and fewer tokens, resulting in tokens becoming increasingly valuable. 

5.Victims cann't transfer token MIKE, only the hacker can. 

6.The hacker can mint token MIKE infinitely by `incrementAllowance()`. With infinite money, hacker could get all the WETH in liquidity pool.
