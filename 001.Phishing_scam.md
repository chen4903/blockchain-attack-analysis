## analyses

The contract is so simple:

- abstract contract Context: normal
- Ownable: normal
- ClaimRewards: only owner can call `withdraw()`. The other functions contain nothing but receive money

The web3 world is so noisy, why there is so many stupid guys? The contract has been verified, but they don't have a glance even.
